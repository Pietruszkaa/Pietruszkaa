## About

Technical school student.

Software and hardware projects here are personal, interest-driven work developed in free time.

Primary focus:
- desktop applications  
- systems-oriented tools  
- experimentation and architectural design  

The only formal overlap with school is CAD access (Autodesk Inventor).
Everything else is self-directed.

---

## Overview

This profile contains software and hardware projects in various stages:

- structured and evolving  
- paused  
- experimental  
- concept-level  

Not all projects are intended to be completed.
